# New References Summary

## References Added in Integrated Discussion Section 4.5

### 1. Ivanov et al. 2016 - Network Physiology Framework
**Citation**: `\cite{Ivanov2016}`

**Used in section**: 4.5.1 (Why "Coupling"?)

**Purpose**: Establishes the concept of network physiology and how physiological systems dynamically interact. Provides authoritative framework for discussing physiological coupling.

**Context in text**:
> "In physiological systems, **coupling** refers to the condition where two systems influence each other such that the state of one system systematically affects the dynamics of the other \cite{Ivanov2016}."

**BibTeX entry**: Ivanov, P.Ch., Liu, K.K.L., & Bartsch, R.P. (2016). Focus on the emerging new fields of network physiology and network medicine. *New Journal of Physics*, 18(10), 100201.

### 2. Bashan et al. 2012 - Network Topology and Physiological Function
**Citation**: `\cite{Bashan2012}`

**Used in section**: 4.5.1 (Why "Coupling"?)

**Purpose**: Provides evidence for how state constraint in coupled systems relates to network topology and physiological function. Supports the concept that coupling involves state space constraint.

**Context in text**:
> "Fetal HR dynamics become more predictable and regular during maternal decelerations, indicating fewer accessible dynamical states—a hallmark of coupling in complex systems \cite{Bashan2012}."

**BibTeX entry**: Bashan, A., Bartsch, R.P., Kantelhardt, J.W., Havlin, S., & Ivanov, P.Ch. (2012). Network physiology reveals relations between network topology and physiological function. *Nature Communications*, 3, 702.

### 3. Bartsch et al. 2015 - Dynamic Organ System Interactions
**Citation**: `\cite{Bartsch2015}`

**Used in section**: 4.5.1 (Why "Coupling"?)

**Purpose**: Demonstrates standard usage of "coupling" terminology in systems physiology for cardiorespiratory coupling, neurovascular coupling, and autonomic coupling.

**Context in text**:
> "The term 'coupling' is standard in systems physiology for similar phenomena: cardiorespiratory coupling (heart rate coupled to breathing rhythm), neurovascular coupling (neural activity coupled to blood flow), and autonomic coupling (sympathetic/parasympathetic systems coupled) \cite{Bartsch2015}."

### 4. Seron-Ferre et al. 2012 - Fetal Circadian Rhythms
**Citation**: `\cite{Seron-Ferre2007}` (Note: The 2012 paper is cited, but label uses 2007 for consistency)

**Used in section**: 4.5.4 (Mechanisms - Coordinated Rest Periods)

**Purpose**: Supports the concept that fetal physiological states can be entrained to maternal circadian rhythms, activity patterns, and metabolic cycles.

**Context in text**:
> "This interpretation aligns with broader principles of maternal-fetal coordination, where fetal physiological states may be entrained to maternal circadian rhythms, activity patterns, and metabolic cycles \cite{Seron-Ferre2007}."

**BibTeX entry**: Seron-Ferre, M., Mendez, N., Abarzua-Catalan, L., et al. (2012). Circadian rhythms in the fetus. *Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology*, 349(1), 68-75.

**Alternative**: If a 2007 paper is specifically intended, see the alternate BibTeX entry in NEW_REFERENCES_BIBTEX.bib

## Integration Notes

### References Already in Manuscript (No Action Needed)
These were already cited and don't need new BibTeX entries:
- `\cite{Grossman2007}` - RSA and vagal tone
- `\cite{Lobmaier2020}` - Your previous BPRSA/FSI work
- `\cite{Pinheiro2000}` - Mixed linear models
- `\cite{Lazic2010}` - Pseudoreplication
- `\cite{Aarts2014}` - Statistical methods
- `\cite{Button2013}` - Replication crisis

### Verification Required
Please verify that:
1. **Ivanov2016** is the intended network physiology reference (this is a highly cited foundational paper)
2. **Bashan2012** appropriately supports the state constraint concept (Nature Communications paper on network topology)
3. **Bartsch2015** covers the standard coupling examples mentioned (PLOS ONE review)
4. **Seron-Ferre** year matches your intent - the 2012 review is comprehensive, but if you want a 2007 paper specifically, use the alternative entry provided

### Total New Citations
**4 new references** added to support the foundational "why coupling" explanation and mechanistic framework.

All references are from highly reputable sources:
- 2 from *Nature Communications* / *New Journal of Physics*
- 1 from *PLOS ONE*
- 1 from *Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology*

These are appropriate for establishing the theoretical framework of physiological coupling and maternal-fetal coordination.
