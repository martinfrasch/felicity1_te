# Abstract

**Background:** The Fetal Stress Index (FSI), derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging (BPRSA) of maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, has demonstrated that prenatal maternal stress alters fetal autonomic responses to maternal physiological fluctuations. However, the information-theoretical foundations underlying these coupling phenomena remain unexplored.

**Objective:** To extend the FSI framework by characterizing maternal-fetal heart rate coupling through information-theoretical measures—transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE)—revealing the mechanisms underlying stress-sensitive physiological communication between mother and fetus.

**Methods:** In 120 pregnant women (58 stressed, 62 control) with third-trimester recordings, we computed 52 entropy features under multiple conditioning paradigms (full recording, acceleration epochs, deceleration epochs). Mixed linear models with random intercepts accounted for repeated measures within participants. Exploratory correlations examined associations with maternal cortisol, perceived stress, and infant Bayley neurodevelopmental outcomes.

**Results:** We identified dual coupling mechanisms operating simultaneously: temporal information transfer (TE) and state-dependent synchronization (conditioned entropy). These pathways exhibit differential stress sensitivity. State-dependent coupling proved stress-invariant, with maternal heart rate decelerations reducing fetal entropy by approximately 60%—a fundamental coordination mechanism conserved across demographic groups. In contrast, exploratory analyses suggested temporal coupling (TE) associates with maternal cortisol, though these correlations did not survive false discovery rate correction and require replication.

A robust sex-by-stress interaction in TE emerged from mixed linear model analysis, with exploratory sex-stratified correlations revealing female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance appeared in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetal signals and independent of sex or stress, likely reflecting fundamental autonomic developmental constraints.

Methodologically, initial t-test analyses suggesting sex effects in acceleration patterns completely disappeared in mixed linear models, demonstrating that proper accounting for repeated measures fundamentally changes biological conclusions.

**Conclusions:** Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal heart rate coupling operates through complementary pathways: stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization (conditioned entropy) representing fundamental physiological coordination, and stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE) potentially reflecting the autonomic "over-sensitization" in stressed fetuses previously documented via BPRSA. The profound asymmetry in coupling—with maternal decelerations exerting dominant influence on fetal dynamics—may reflect respiratory-cardiovascular coupling mechanisms where vagal activation during maternal expiration creates particularly potent coordination conditions.

These findings extend the FSI biomarker framework by elucidating mechanistic foundations, demonstrating that multiple complementary information-theoretical measures may be needed for comprehensive assessment of maternal-fetal physiological communication. The exploratory sex-differentiated patterns, while requiring replication in adequately powered samples, align with emerging evidence of sexually dimorphic fetal stress responses. Mixed linear models prove essential for valid inference from hierarchical physiological data, with methods assuming independence producing spuriously significant results through pseudoreplication.

**Clinical Implications:** Information-theoretical measures provide mechanistic depth to FSI-based stress assessment, potentially enabling multimodal biomarker approaches combining stress-sensitive temporal coupling (TE) with stress-invariant coordination measures (conditioned entropy). State-dependent coupling may serve as a reference for identifying compromised maternal-fetal communication in pathological conditions.

# Structured Abstract

## Background
The Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging demonstrated that prenatal maternal stress alters fetal autonomic responses to maternal physiological fluctuations. The information-theoretical mechanisms underlying these coupling phenomena remain unexplored.

## Objective
To extend the Fetal Stress Index framework using transfer entropy, entropy rate, and sample entropy to characterize maternal-fetal heart rate coupling and its modulation by maternal stress.

## Study Design
Prospective cohort study of 120 pregnant women (58 stressed, 62 control) in third trimester.

## Methods
We computed 52 entropy features under multiple conditioning paradigms and employed mixed linear models to account for repeated measures. Exploratory correlations examined associations with maternal cortisol and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes.

## Results
Dual coupling mechanisms emerged: stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization (maternal decelerations reducing fetal entropy ~60%) and stress-sensitive temporal information transfer. Sex-by-stress interactions in transfer entropy were robust in mixed models, with exploratory female-specific patterns requiring replication. Universal acceleration predominance appeared independent of demographics. Initial t-test sex effects disappeared in mixed models, demonstrating pseudoreplication artifacts.

## Conclusions
Information-theoretical analysis reveals complementary maternal-fetal coupling pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index framework by elucidating mechanistic foundations. Mixed linear models are essential for valid inference from repeated-measures physiological data.

## Clinical Implications
Multiple information-theoretical measures may improve maternal-fetal stress assessment beyond single biomarkers, with state-dependent coupling serving as reference for pathological conditions.

Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging.

We identified dual coupling mechanisms: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations reducing fetal entropy by approximately 60%—a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males.

Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging (BPRSA). We extended this framework using novel information-theoretical measures—transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE)—to elucidate coupling mechanisms and their stress sensitivity.

In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed 52 entropy features under multiple conditioning paradigms (full recording, acceleration/deceleration epochs). Mixed linear models with random intercepts accounted for repeated measures, while exploratory correlations examined associations with maternal cortisol and infant Bayley neurodevelopmental outcomes.

We identified dual coupling mechanisms with differential stress sensitivity. State-dependent synchronization (conditioned entropy) proved stress-invariant: maternal heart rate decelerations reduced fetal entropy by approximately 60%, representing fundamental physiological coordination conserved across sex and stress groups. Conversely, temporal information transfer (TE) showed exploratory associations with maternal cortisol, though these did not survive false discovery rate correction and require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males.

Universal acceleration predominance appeared in maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger fetally and independent of demographics. Critically, initial t-test analyses suggesting sex effects completely disappeared in mixed linear models, demonstrating pseudoreplication artifacts when repeated measures are ignored.

Information-theoretical analysis reveals complementary maternal-fetal coupling pathways, extending the Fetal Stress Index framework by elucidating mechanistic foundations.
