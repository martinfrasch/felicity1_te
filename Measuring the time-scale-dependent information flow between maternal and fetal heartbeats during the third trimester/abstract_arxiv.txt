Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging. Here, we extend this framework using information-theoretical measures to elucidate underlying mechanisms. In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures.

We identify dual coupling mechanisms at the short-term (0.5-2.5 s), but not long-term (2.5 - 5 s) time scales: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity--a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance was observed in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetuses and independent of sex or stress.

We provide insight into the dependence of these findings on the sampling rate of the underlying data, identifying 4 Hz, commonly used for ultrasound-derived fetal heart rate recordings, as the necessary and sufficient sampling rate regime to capture the information flow. Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating causal foundations. Future studies should explore additional information-theoretical conditional approaches to resolve stress-specific and time-scale-specific differences in information flow.
