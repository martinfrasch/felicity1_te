  Abstract                 = {Objective information on specific fetal heart rate (FHR) parameters would be advantageous when assessing fetal responses to hypoxia. Small, visually undetectable changes in FHR variability can be quantified by power spectral analysis of FHR variability.To investigate the effect of intrapartum hypoxia and acidemia on spectral powers of FHR variability.This is a retrospective observational clinical study with data from an EU multicenter project.We had 462 fetuses with a normal pH-value (pH>7.20; controls) in fetal scalp blood sample (FBS) and 81 fetuses with a low scalp pH-value (≤ 7.20; low-FBS pH-fetuses). The low-FBS pH-fetuses were further divided into two subgroups according to the degree of acidemia: fetuses with FBS pH7.11-7.20 (n = 58) and fetuses with FBS pH ≤7.10 (n = 23).Spectral powers of FHR variability in relation to the concomitant FBS pH-value.Fetuses with FBS pH ≤7.20 had increased spectral powers of FHR variability compared with controls (2.49 AU vs. 2.23 AU; p = 0.038). However, the subgroup of most affected fetuses (those with FBS pH ≤7.10) had significantly lower FHR variability spectral powers when compared to fetuses with FBS pH7.11-7.20.This study shows that spectral powers of FHR variability change as a fetus becomes hypoxic, and that spectral powers decrease with deepening fetal acidemia.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether intrapartum acidosis affects specific components of fetal heart rate variability. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Twelve Nordic delivery units. SUBJECTS: Fetal heart rate variability was studied in 334 fetuses divided into two groups according to cord pH value: the acidotic group (cord arterial pH < 7.05 at birth, n= 15) and the control group (cord arterial pH > or =7.05 at birth, n= 319). METHODS: In spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability, frequencies were integrated over the total frequency band (0.04-1.0 Hz), low-frequency band (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency band (0.15-1.0 Hz). We also calculated the low-to-high frequency ratio. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The spectral bands of fetal heart rate variability were compared between the acidotic and control fetuses. RESULTS: We found that during the last hour of monitoring, baseline fetal heart rate gradually decreased, whereas total, low-frequency and high-frequency fetal heart rate variability initially increased but then, near the delivery, decreased in the acidotic fetuses when compared with the controls. Low-to-high frequency ratio was greater in the acidotic group during the whole study period (P= 0.002). Cord artery pH was inversely associated with total fetal heart rate variability (P < 0.001), low-frequency fetal heart rate variability (P < 0.001) and low-to-high frequency ratio (P= 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Marked fetal acidosis was associated with frequency-specific changes in fetal heart rate variability as reflecting the compensation ability of autonomic nervous activation during the last hour of labour.},

	Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005), EMBASE (1974 to December

	Research Register (December 2005).Randomised and quasi-randomised
	controlled trials involving a comparison of continuous cardiotocography
	(with and without fetal blood sampling) with (a) no fetal monitoring,
	(b) intermittent auscultation (c) intermittent cardiotocography.Two
	authors independently assessed eligibility, quality and extracted
	data.Twelve trials were included (over 37,000 women); only two were
	high quality. Compared to intermittent auscultation, continuous cardiotocography
	showed no significant difference in overall perinatal death rate
	(relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.23,
	n = 33,513, 11 trials), but was associated with a halving of neonatal
	seizures (RR 0.50, 95\% CI 0.31 to 0.80, n = 32,386, nine trials)
	although no significant difference was detected in cerebral palsy
	(RR 1.74, 95\% CI 0.97 to 3.11, n = 13,252, two trials). There was
	a significant increase in caesarean sections associated with continuous
	cardiotocography (RR 1.66, 95\% CI 1.30 to 2.13, n =18,761, 10 trials).
	Women were also more likely to have an instrumental vaginal birth
	(RR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.32, n = 18,151, nine trials). Data for
	subgroups of low-risk, high-risk, preterm pregnancies and high quality
	trials were consistent with overall results. Access to fetal blood
	sampling did not appear to influence the difference in neonatal seizures
	nor any other prespecified outcome.Continuous cardiotocography during
	labour is associated with a reduction in neonatal seizures, but no
	significant differences in cerebral palsy, infant mortality or other
	standard measures of neonatal well-being. However, continuous cardiotocography
	was associated with an increase in caesarean sections and instrumental
	vaginal births. The real challenge is how best to convey this uncertainty
	to women to enable them to make an informed choice without compromising
	the normality of labour.},

	of fetal state, which is mainly based on the recording and analysis
	of fetal heart rate (FHR) signal. Computerized systems for fetal
	monitoring provide a quantitative analysis of FHR signals, however
	the effective methods of qualitative assessment that could support
	the process of medical diagnosis are still needed. The measurements
	of hydronium ions concentration (pH) in neonatal cord blood are an
	objective indicator of the fetal outcome. Improper pH level is a
	symptom of acidemia being the result of fetal hypoxia. The paper
	proposes a two-step analysis of fetal heart rate recordings that
	allows for effective prediction of the acidemia risk. The first step
	consists in fuzzy classification of FHR signals. Fuzzy inference
	corresponds to the clinical interpretation of signals based on the
	FIGO guidelines. The goal of inference is to eliminate recordings
	indicating the fetal wellbeing from the further classification process.
	In the second step, the remained recordings are nonlinearly classified
	using multilayer perceptron and Lagrangian Support Vector Machines
	(LSVM). The proposed procedures are evaluated using data collected
	with computerized fetal surveillance system. The assessment performance
	is evaluated with the number of correct classifications (CC) and
	quality index (QI) defined as the geometric mean of sensitivity and
	specificity. The highest CC = 92.0% and QI = 88.2% were achieved
	for the Weighted Fuzzy Scoring System combined with the LSVM algorithm.
	The obtained results confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods
	of computerized analysis of FHR signals in the evaluation of the
	risk of neonatal acidemia. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	(STAN) alone or in combination with fetal blood sampling (FBS) is
	a worldwide debate. STAN monitoring without FBS support was implemented
	in 2000 in the authors' department when it took part in a European
	multicentre project. The aim of this study was to evaluate neonatal
	outcomes associated with peripartum STAN monitoring without FBS support
	in a large prospective cohort of patients at high risk of peripartum
	fetal asphyxia.This prospective cohort study included all consecutive
	high-risk women monitored with STAN technology over a 77-month period,
	excluding fetuses with congenital anomalies. Outcome variables were
	fetal metabolic acidosis, umbilical pH≤7.05 and normal extracellular
	base deficit, transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal
	encephalopathy and neonatal death related to peripartum asphyxia.
	Cases with metabolic acidosis were reviewed by a referent midwife
	and referent obstetricians to check whether or not labour management
	was consistent with the STAN guidelines.In total, 3112 women were
	included in the study. The caesarean section rate for suspected fetal
	distress was 9.5\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 8.5-10.5]. Acid-base
	status was available for 3067 (98.5\%) neonates. There were 14 cases
	of fetal metabolic acidosis (0.45\%; 95\% CI 0.2-0.7), 62 cases with
	umbilical pH ≤ 7.05 and normal extracellular base deficit (2\%; 95\%
	CI 1.5-2.5), 27 neonates with 5-min Apgar scores ≤ 7 (0.87\%; 95\%
	CI 0.54-1.20) and 16 neonates were transferred to the neonatal intensive
	care unit (0.51\%; 95\% CI 0.26-0.76) due to peripartum asphyxia.
	No cases of neonatal encephalopathy, or fetal or neonatal death occurred.
	Out of the 14 cases of fetal metabolic acidosis, 11 were not managed
	in accordance with the STAN guidelines. Specificity was 80.5\% and
	the negative predictive value was 99.9\%. Sensitivity was highly
	affected by medical staff interpretation, varying from 9.1\% in the
	authors' experience to 90.9\% with appropriate labour management
	according to the STAN guidelines.STAN monitoring without FBS support
	was associated with a low rate of fetal metabolic acidosis. Most
	cases of fetal metabolic acidosis were not managed in accordance
	with the STAN guidelines. This study not only supports STAN usage
	without FBS support, but also warns of possible guideline violations
	and subsequent adverse neonatal outcomes.},

	can be relaxed by allowing the possibility of using averaged fetal

	fragmented fetal heart rate series involving up to 50\% of random

  abstract = {In the framework of information dynamics, the temporal evolution of
	coupled systems can be studied by decomposing the predictive information
	about an assigned target system into amounts quantifying the information
	stored inside the system and the information transferred to it. While
	information storage and transfer are computed through the known self-entropy
	(SE) and transfer entropy (TE), an alternative decomposition evidences
	the so-called cross entropy (CE) and conditional SE (cSE), quantifying
	the cross information and internal information of the target system,
	respectively. This study presents a thorough evaluation of SE, TE,
	CE and cSE as quantities related to the causal statistical structure
	of coupled dynamic processes. First, we investigate the theoretical
	properties of these measures, providing the conditions for their
	existence and assessing the meaning of the information theoretic
	quantity that each of them reflects. Then, we present an approach
	for the exact computation of information dynamics based on the linear
	Gaussian approximation, and exploit this approach to characterize
	the behavior of SE, TE, CE and cSE in benchmark systems with known
	dynamics. Finally, we exploit these measures to study cardiorespiratory
	dynamics measured from healthy subjects during head-up tilt and paced
	breathing protocols. Our main result is that the combined evaluation
	of the measures of information dynamics allows to infer the causal
	effects associated with the observed dynamics and to interpret the
	alteration of these effects with changing experimental conditions.},

  comment = {This paper introduces the terminology. 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0Baseline
	fetal heart rate1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0 is the mean level of the
	fetal heart rate when this is stable, accelerations and decelerations
	being absent. It is determined over a time period of 5 or 10 min
	and expressed in beats/min (bpm). 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0Variability1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0
	- under physiological conditions the fetal beat-to-beat intervals
	are constantly subject to small changes. This is called 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0short
	term variability1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0. Due to a certain periodicity
	in the direction and size of these changes they result in oscillations
	of fetal heart rate around its mean level. These oscillations are
	called 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0long term variability1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0.
	In the FHR tracings short term variability is superimposed on long
	term variability in the form of minimal deflexions. However, these
	cannot be reliably interpreted by the naked eye using the standard
	equipment. Therefore, in clinical practice variability means long
	term variability. This is how the term will be used in these guidelines.
	Long term variability is characterized by the frequency and the amplitude
	of the oscillations. Although the frequency may be important, it
	is difficult to assess correctly. Therefore variability is usually
	only quantitated by description of the amplitude of the oscillations
	around the baseline heart rate. 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0Accelerations1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0
	- transient increase in heart rate of 15 beats/min or more and lasting
	15 s or more. 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0Decelerations1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0
	- transient episodes of slowing of fetal heart rate below the baseline
	level of more than 15 beats/min and lasting 10 s or more. Fetal heart
	rate monitoring, like all other techniques, has limitations. The
	main risks, when using 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0autocorrelation1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0,
	are the missing of fetal arrythmia or to mistake maternal heart rate
	for fetal heart rate. Four main factors should be taken into account:
	(a) gestational age (b) maternal position (c) the state of fetal
	activity (d) drugs administered to the mother, including anesthesia
	and analgesia. 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0Quiet pattern1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0
	with stable baseline heart rate, absence of accelerations or decelerations
	and relatively low variability. 0RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0Active pattern1RW1S34RfeSDcfkexd09rT0
	with somewhat variable baseline heart rate and intermittent accelerations
	(active sleep) or more continuous accelerations (active state). The
	above states come in cycles. A quiet pattern may last up to 40 min.},

	'alpha' of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has remained mysterious
	because there has been no explanation of its meaning, particularly
	in relation to spectral analysis. First, we present a mathematical
	analysis of the meaning of alpha, in weighted power-spectral terms.
	Second, we test this hypothesis and observe correlations between
	DFA-based and weighted spectral methods of 0.97 (P < 0.0001) for
	alpha1 and 0.98 (P < 0.0001) for alpha2. Third, we predict mathematically
	that even in conventional (unweighted) spectral analysis there should
	be approximate counterparts to DFA, namely that alpha1 and alpha2
	behave broadly in proportion to the conventional (unweighted) ratios
	LF/(HF + LF) and VLF/(LF + VLF), respectively, where HF is high frequency,
	LF is low frequency and VLF is very low frequency. Fourth, we test
	this hypothesis by physiologically manipulating spectral ratios in
	healthy volunteers in two ways. The effect of 0.1 Hz controlled breathing
	on LF/(HF + LF) correlates markedly with the effect on alpha1 (r
	= 0.73, P = 0.01); the effect on VLF/(LF + VLF) correlates markedly
	with that on alpha2 (r = 0.76, P < 0.01). Likewise, with voluntary
	periodic breathing the reduction in alpha2 correlates strongly with
	that in VLF/(LF + VLF) (r = 0.88, P < 0.001); effects on alpha1 and
	LF/(HF + LF) again clearly correlate (r = 0.73, P = 0.01). Finally,
	we examine published literature to identify previously undiscussed
	evidence of the relationship between alpha1 and LF/(HF + LF). We
	conclude that the alpha1 and alpha2 indices are simply frequency-weighted
	versions of the spectral ratios LF/(HF + LF) and VLF/(LF + VLF),
	respectively, multiplied by two (giving a range of 0-2). We can now
	understand fractal manifestations of physiological abnormalities:
	depressed baroreflex sensitivity low LF/HF low LF/(HF + LF) low alpha1,
	while periodic breathing high VLF/LF high VLF/(LF + VLF) high alpha2.
	Prognostic associations of alpha are no longer mysterious.},

  abstract = {Rationale, aims and objectives To evaluate obstetricians' inter- and
	intra-observer agreement on intrapartum cardiotocogram (CTG) recordings
	and to examine obstetricians' evaluations with respect to umbilical
	artery pH and base deficit. Methods Nine experienced obstetricians
	annotated 634 intrapartum CTG recordings. The evaluation of each
	recording was divided into four steps: evaluation of two 30-minute
	windows in the first stage of labour, evaluation of one window in
	the second stage of labour and labour outcome prediction. The complete
	set of evaluations used for this experiment is available online.
	The inter- and intra-observer agreement was evaluated using proportion
	of agreement and kappa coefficient. Clinicians' sensitivity and specificity
	was computed with respect to umbilical artery pH, base deficit and
	to Apgar score at the fifth minute. Results The overall proportion
	of agreement between clinicians reached 48% with 95% confidence intervals
	(CI) (CI: 47â50). Regarding the different classes, proportion of
	agreement ranged from 57% (CI: 54â60) for normal to 41% (CI: 36â46)
	for pathological class. The sensitivity of clinicians' majority vote
	to objective outcome was 39% (CI: 16â63) for the umbilical artery
	base deficit and 27% (CI: 16â42) for pH. The specificity was 89%
	(CI: 86â92) for both types of objective outcome. Conclusions The
	reported inter-/intra-observer variability is large and this holds
	irrespective of clinicians' experience or work place. The results
	support the need of modernized guidelines for CTG evaluation and/or
	objectivization and repeatability by introduction of a computerized
	approach that could standardize the process of CTG evaluation within
	the delivery ward.},

	Three groups were analyzed: 1) 19 women had normal labors (uncomplicated
	course of labor, vaginal delivery, no unusual FHR tracings, and 1-
	and 5-minute Apgar scores of at least 7 and 9, respectively; 2) 15
	women had presumed fetal distress (severe cord or late decelerations,
	bradycardia, or tachycardia; delivery by cesarean with both arterial
	and venous cord pH above 7.20); and 3) 20 women had acidotic fetuses
	(both venous and arterial cord pH less than 7.20). Hourly mean (+/-
	SD) ApEn values for the three groups were: acidotic fetuses, 0.924
	+/- 0.235, 102 hours; normal fetuses, 1.051 +/- 0.145, 97 hours;
	and nonacidotic "distressed" fetuses, 1.043 +/- 0.147, 74 hours.
	The ApEn values for nonacidotic, presumed distressed fetuses were
	not significantly different from those of normal fetuses (P greater
	than .75). Acidotic fetuses had many more instances of ApEn hourly
	values less than 0.8 (28\%, 29 of 102) than did the normal and the
	nonacidotic, presumed distressed fetuses combined (5\%, nine of 171).
	The probability that ApEn was less than 0.8 was larger for acidotic
	fetuses than for the other groups (P less than .00003), supporting
	the hypothesis that extremely regular FHR patterns imply a greater
	likelihood of acidosis. Significant hourly deviations in ApEn generally
	corresponded to drug administration or to physiologic changes such
	as cord compression and its relief. Thus ApEn, a major departure
	from variability statistics, appears to be able to detect subtle

  abstract = {The interpretation and analysis of intrapartum fetal heart rate (FHR),
	enabling early detection of fetal acidosis, remains a challenging
	signal processing task. The ability of entropy rate measures, amongst
	other tools, to characterize temporal dynamics of FHR variability
	and to discriminate non-healthy fetuses has already been massively
	investigated. The present contribution aims first at illustrating
	that a k-nearest neighbor procedure yields estimates for entropy
	rates that are robust and well-suited to FHR variability (compared
	to the more commonly used correlation-integral algorithm). Second,
	it investigates how entropy rates measured on multiresolution wavelet
	and approximation coefficients permit to improve classification performance.
	To that end, a supervised learning procedure is used, that selects
	the time scales at which entropy rates contribute to discrimination.
	Significant conclusions are obtained from a high quality scalp electrode
	database of nearly two thousands subjects collected in a French public
	university hospital.},
