%    group - these are appropriate for discussing physiological coupling
% 3. For Seron-Ferre2007, I provided both a 2012 review (most comprehensive)
%    and a 2007 paper - use whichever matches your citation intent
% 4. If you have different papers in mind, please replace with actual references
% 5. All DOIs and abstracts should be verified before final submission
