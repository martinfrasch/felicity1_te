## Overview

This repository contains the complete research materials for an academic study analyzing maternal-fetal heart rate coupling using information-theoretical measures. The research examines how prenatal maternal stress affects physiological communication between mother and fetus through analysis of transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE).

### Key Findings

- **Dual Coupling Mechanisms**: Identified stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization and stress-sensitive temporal information transfer
- **60% Coupling Strength**: Maternal heart rate decelerations exert approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity
- **Sex-by-Stress Interaction**: Robust sex-by-stress interaction in transfer entropy from mixed linear models
- **Optimal Sampling**: 4 Hz identified as optimal sampling rate for information flow capture

## Abstract

Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging. We extended this framework using information-theoretical measures to elucidate underlying mechanisms. In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures.

We identified dual coupling mechanisms: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength—a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males.

Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating mechanistic foundations. Multiple entropy measures may improve stress assessment, with state-dependent coupling serving as a reference for pathological conditions.

## Key Results

### Coupling Strength

- Effect conserved across sex and stress groups
- Represents fundamental physiological coordination

### Transfer Entropy
- Sex-by-stress interaction (p < 0.05 in mixed linear models)
- Exploratory associations with maternal cortisol (not FDR-corrected)
- Requires independent replication

### Acceleration Predominance
- Universal pattern in maternal and fetal heart rates
- Stronger in fetal signals
- Independent of sex or stress status

### Methodological Insights
- Mixed linear models essential for repeated measures
- Initial t-test sex effects disappeared with proper statistical modeling
- Demonstrates importance of accounting for pseudoreplication
